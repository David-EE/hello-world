# hello-world
First repository
Hello all, My name is David Nelson and I am a Electrical Engineering student at FIU. I will be starting my concentrations in Communications, Embedded Systems and Network Forensic and Cyber Security. Coding is an addiction for me with C++, Java and Python being my top three. GitHub is a wealth of information and love exploring what it has to offer so I am here to contribute my projects.
